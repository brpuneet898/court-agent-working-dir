His act of forwarding the UPSI through WhatsApp messages was considered a direct communication of such information, violating insider trading regulations.

However, the gravity of circulating highly accurate UPSI through private channels was emphasized as a significant threat to market integrity and fairness, creating information asymmetry.

Despite his claims of unawareness of the proposal's definitive nature or the identity of the companies, evidence from emails clearly indicated the acquisition details and the Board meeting date. His argument regarding the non-closure of the trading window was also rejected, as the definition of UPSI is broader than criteria for trading window closure.

The judgment relied on the principle that an insider's trading while in possession of UPSI is presumed to be based on that information unless proven otherwise, applying circumstantial evidence and precedents from the Securities Appellate Tribunal.","The Adjudicating Officer (AO) noted that the Show Cause Notices (SCNs) did not specifically quantify 'disproportionate gain or unfair advantage' (Section 15J(a)) or 'loss caused to an investor' (Section 15J(b)), nor was there evidence of 'repetitive nature of the default' (Section 15J(c)) for direct application of these penalty factors. Despite earlier mentioning a profit of Rs. 42,58,117 made by the Noticee, the AO stated that no case regarding quantum of unlawful gains was made out in the SCNs. Therefore, considering the overall facts and circumstances, the AO imposed a monetary penalty of Rs. 7,63,908, deeming it 'commensurate with the defaults committed' without providing a specific calculation directly linked to the stated profit amount or the maximum penalty allowed under Section 15G.",This case concerns insider trading by a connected person who traded and communicated Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) related to a corporate acquisition.,"['Regulation 3(i) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992', 'Regulation 3(ii) of SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992', 'Section 15G of SEBI Act, 1992']",Trading on Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI); Communication of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI),"Hemant Patel, an insider and connected person, traded shares of KLG Capital Services Ltd. based on unpublished price-sensitive information about an impending acquisition.
