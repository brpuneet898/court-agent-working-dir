      "  \"Judgment Criteria\": \"The information regarding Biocon's collaboration with Sandoz was deemed Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) as it was not generally available and materially affected stock price upon announcement. The UPSI period was established from December 20, 2017, to January 18, 2018. Mr. Tambe, being a senior designated person and aware of the UPSI as confirmed by Biocon, was found to be an 'insider'. He traded in company shares during the UPSI period, violating trading prohibitions. His justifications (bona fide purpose, no secret profit, trading contrary to UPSI) were rejected as they do not negate possession of UPSI or address information asymmetry. Additionally, he violated the code of conduct by seeking pre-clearance while possessing UPSI and providing a false declaration. He also failed to make timely disclosures for trades exceeding the prescribed value within two trading days, constituting a mandatory disclosure violation.\",\n",
