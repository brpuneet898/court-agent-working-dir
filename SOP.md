# TLB Intern Validation SOP

**Objective**:  
Ensure that fields and cluster labels auto-extracted from SEBI orders are accurate and align with human judgment.

---

## Purpose & Scope

This SOP guides interns to validate a batch of 10 SEBI orders within 48 hours. It ensures that metadata, tags, clusters, and UI tooltips generated by the TLB pipeline are accurate and reflect the original source PDF. The goal is to maintain quality and consistency in the dataset used for downstream analysis.

## Inputs

You will receive the following:
- A **CSV template** with:
  - Case IDs  
  - Extracted metadata  
  - NLP-generated violation tags  
  - Cluster labels  
  - Links to order PDFs  
- Access to:
  - The original **SEBI order PDFs**  
  - Streamlit UI with tooltip visualization  
  - Silhouette plots for cluster evaluation  
  - Jupyter notebook outputs for NLP tag review

---

## Step-by-Step Checklist

| Step | Task | Validation Source |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1. | **Confirm metadata accuracy**: Ensure `case ID`, `date`, and `penalty` match the PDF. | PDF vs MongoDB |
| 2. | **Review violation tags**: Compare manual tag with NLP-generated tag. | Notebook output |
| 3. | **Assess cluster coherence**: Does the assigned cluster make contextual sense? | Silhouette plot |
| 4. | **Check tooltip accuracy**: Hover in Streamlit UI and verify alignment with PDF. | UI vs PDF |

## Turnaround Time

- Validate each batch of **10 SEBI orders** within **48 hours**.
